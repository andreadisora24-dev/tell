## PythonAnywhere Setup Instructions:

1. **Upload Files:**
   - Upload all project files to your PythonAnywhere account
   - Ensure the project is in your home directory (e.g., /home/yourusername/teleshop)

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip3.10 install --user -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Environment:**
   - Edit the .env file with your actual values
   - Ensure BOT_TOKEN, ADMIN_IDS, and SECRET_KEY are properly set

4. **Set up Always-On Task:**
   - Go to your PythonAnywhere dashboard
   - Navigate to "Tasks" tab
   - Create a new always-on task
   - Command: `python3.10 /home/yourusername/teleshop/start_bot.py`
   - Replace "yourusername" with your actual username

5. **Verify Deployment:**
   - Check the task logs for any errors
   - Test the bot by sending /start command
   - Monitor the logs directory for application logs

## Important Notes:

- The database has been cleared and reinitialized
- All previous data has been backed up to deployment_backups/
- The bot is configured to run continuously via the always-on task
- Logs will be stored in the logs/ directory
- File uploads will be stored in the uploads/ directory

## Troubleshooting:

- If the bot doesn't start, check the always-on task logs
- Ensure all environment variables are properly set in .env
- Verify that the file paths in start_bot.py match your directory structure
- Check that all dependencies are installed for the correct Python version

## Support:

If you encounter issues, check the logs in the logs/ directory for detailed error messages.
